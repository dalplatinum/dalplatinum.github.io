No, I don't really know what I'm doing.  Why do you ask?

This is a basic canvas/javascript concoction that will display/animate words against a transparent background, for use on stream overlays and such.

url format is like ?words=<whatever you want it to say>&style=<style>
Style options are:
  		'vanilla',
			'arc',
			'bubbles',
			'solitaire',
			'stickmove',
			'bounce'
Or just leave the style bit off and get a random one.
I'll add more styles as I a) think of them, and b) learn how to make them work.
